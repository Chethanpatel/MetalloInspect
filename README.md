# Metal surface defect detection

The aim of this project is to use deep learning to classify 6 possible defects on metal surfaces:
- 0: Crazing
- 1: Inclusions
- 2: Patches
- 3: Pitted Surface
- 4: Rolled in Scale
- 5: Scratches

Two types of datasets were used in the project: the first with only 90 images (15 for each defect: 60 in the training set and 30 in the test set) and the second, 
with which the best results were achieved, with 1800 images (300 for each defect: 1620 in the training set and 180 in the test set). 

The whole project was carried out entirely in Python can be found on the [Jupyter Notebook](Metal_Surface_Defects_Detection.ipynb) with Python code, output and comments.
